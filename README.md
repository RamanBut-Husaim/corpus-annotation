# Corpus Annotation

A Hyperskill Graduate project for Introduction for NLP course.

The idea is to grab the source corpus, execute NER (named-entity recognition) with the help of [spaCy](https://spacy.io/api/token) library and gather various metrics from the corpus.

The input: the path to the file with the corpus.
